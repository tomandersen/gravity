    // waves can reach us from our own previous emissions.
    
    // Waves reach us from our previous emissions by being reflected back off of (perhaps distant) emission points.
    // How could such a regime work to make a stable hydrogen atom? Note that in a real atom, energy levels are altered by nearby particles.
    
    // Yet it is our own emissions that we must interact with in order to produce quantum effects.
    
    // distant sphere of reflectors - particles
    // Look to a paper like Trajectory eigenmodes of an orbiting wave source E. FORT1 AND Y. COUDER2 - to see the kind of wave system I am talking about
    // 'inertial waves' - like any relativisitic source, radiate in a sphere independent of the velocity of the particle (at c) and also have doppler frequency effects, etc.
    
    // Particle Model:
    // The paricle is a super radiant capable geometric object - a naked Kerr singularity.  The Kerr ring singuarity is unstable wrt to pertubations.
    // A pertubation will result in a quadrupole moment, which causes the non - perfect ring to re - radiate incoming energy that has deformed it.
    // Thus the electron is basically a mirror pump for these Compton frequency gravitational waves. It is thus a standing wave source, where energy
    // is balanced in vs out.
    // The Kerr ring for an electron is very large, and as such rather loosely circular in shape - its actual shape may be more of a fractal like ring.
    // The fractal ring could then perhaps super - radiate (or 'balanced radiate') over a large range of frequencies from the fundamental lowest Compton frequency
    // on up a few orders of magnitude.
    
    // Protons are assumed to be on the same frequency as electrons, having a more complex structure - but having the same outward behavoir of being a standing
    // wave source at the electron compton frequency.
    
    // All of the above comes to a simple model of an inertial walker in the Fort/Couder sense, with energy balanced.
    // The EM force will hopefully arise as a side effect of this energy exhange (shades of QED).
    
    // When we want to see what the effects of a particle's standing waves are when the particle was at t' = (labTime - dt), we
    // need to look at a wave source NOT centered on where the particle was a t' but rather where the particle would be at labTime if it continued
    // on at its current velocity. That point is then taken as the wave source, with wave amplitude and pahse given by the distance the virtual emssion point is from
    // this particle, in the usual 1/r for amplitude 1/r**2 for energy, and speed of light considerations for phase.
    // Summing over the histories of all particles involved gives one the net amplitude (really we need amplitudes and first derviatives of the amplitudes).
    // The force is then the sum of these slopes at the particle location.
