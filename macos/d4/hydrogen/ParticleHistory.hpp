/// The idea is that there is one history object for each particle.
/// x,y,z,t,vx, vy, vz
///
/// If we use lab coordinates, then time will not reflect the time on the particle.
/// It seems to get the emission time we would have to integrate back over the entire path,
/// so that the phase at emission would be correct.
///
///

/// The idea is we need to keep a history of the particles.
/// With a EmQm system, we need to let the particle interact with waves from its past - the memory effect. (only makes sense)
/// So I need a history.

/// When a particle is at a position, it can see waves from its past and the past of all the other particles around it.
/// So for a particle at a point we need to integrate over all positions in the history of the particle(s).
/// We need the sum over the history taking into account radius and phase at emission.
/// having x,y,z,t,vx,vy,vz over determines the particle's state. Perhaps only need xyzt? Or x,y,z,t,vx,vy,vz and T (proper time on the particle).

/// Velocity affects the observed frequency (through lorentz)
/// So with proper time at the particle and velocity, we can get phase and distance from the lead.

/// We will want long particle trails.
/// Use 1D zfp compression. Perhaps compression not needed?
